All of the functions done rn probably have errors because they're untested(tfs_init/tfs_destroy/tfs_mkfs probably dont have major errors, helper functions might tho). Kinda need to get done with them and some of the tfs functions before we can (easily) test them tho so when writing those just assume they work and we can debug the helper functions once we write the actual tfs functions


tfs_get_attr() and tfs_create() (or whatever its called) would probably be the first ones to do as I think those are the first ones called by simple_test
